Welcome to **eugolana**, a calm and pleasant clearing in the jungle of the
interwebs. 


My name is Sam Sharp. I'm a web developer and code artist currently based in
Glasgow. Contact me on eugolana2@gmail.com. I will send a CV on request.


Check out my [gallery](gallery/) of generative artwork, my
[blog](http://eugolana.github.io/blog) (nothing there yet.. sorry),
my [various little projects](projects/) or just hang
out here with the bees.
