Welcome to my gallery!

All these images are generated procedurally using no input images. Most were
coded in python using a variety of homegrown and borrowed algorithms. I hope to
get the chance to do a few write-ups of the techniques I used so keep an eye on
my blog (or pester me) if you're interested. Perhaps eventualy I'll tidy up some
of the code and open source it, but for now it's a tangled mess that even I
sometimes struggle to navigate.

For more interesting generative/algorithmic artists check out

(I'll add a blog post with a more comprehensive history/list of generative
artists at some point)
